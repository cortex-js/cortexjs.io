## Suggestions for Improvement

The existing documentation is well-structured and comprehensive. The following suggestions aim to enhance its consistency and clarity further.

#### 1. Standardize Reference Page Structure
The `combinatorics` and `number-theory` reference pages are excellent models. They provide a clear, concise summary for each function before showing the signature and code examples.
*   **Suggestion:** Adopt this "summary-first" structure for all API reference pages (e.g., `arithmetic`, `collections`). A short, descriptive paragraph explaining what a function like `Sum` or `Product` does and its real-world use case would be very helpful before diving into its signatures.

#### 2. Clarify Distinction Between Callouts
The usage of `:::warning` and `:::caution` is sometimes interchangeable.
*   **Suggestion:** Formalize their use cases as defined in the style guide above:
    *   `warning`: For potential errors, unexpected behavior, or things that might not work as a developer expects (e.g., the `file://` protocol limitations).
    *   `caution`: Reserve this for higher-stakes issues, especially those related to security (like CSP and Trusted Types) or irreversible actions.

#### 3. Enhance Inter-linking
The use of `<ReadMore>` is effective, but there are opportunities for more granular, in-context linking.
*   **Suggestion:** Whenever a technical term from another page is mentioned (e.g., "canonical form," "boxed expression," "MathJSON"), link it directly to its definition page on its first use in an article. This helps readers who may not be reading the documentation sequentially.

#### 4. Expand the Tutorials Section
The "Simple Quiz" tutorial is a fantastic, practical example. Building more of these would significantly improve the learning curve for new users.
*   **Suggestion:** Add tutorials covering other common use cases:
    *   **Building a Scientific Calculator:** A tutorial focused on using `expr.evaluate()` and `expr.N()` with a more complex, customized virtual keyboard.
    *   **Creating a Dynamic Worksheet:** Showcase how to use `readonly` fields with multiple `\placeholder` prompts and dynamically update the content.
    *   **Advanced Symbolic Manipulation:** A guide on using `expr.subs()` and `expr.replace()` to build a simple equation solver or expression transformer.

#### 5. Be Explicit About "Mathfield" vs. "MathfieldElement"
The documentation sometimes uses `mathfield` and `MathfieldElement` interchangeably. While context often makes it clear, being explicit can prevent confusion.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   Use `<math-field>` when referring to the HTML tag.
    *   Use `MathfieldElement` when referring to the JavaScript class or its static properties/methods (`MathfieldElement.computeEngine`).
    *   Use "mathfield" (lowercase) as a general term for an instance of the component on a page.
