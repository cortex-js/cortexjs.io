<Intro>
Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. 
</Intro>

It has two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. 
These two branches are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus:

<center>
$$\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)$$
</center>


...where $ F $ is an **antiderivative** of $ f $, that is $ F' = f $.

**To calculate the derivative of a function**, use the `D` function to
calculate a symbolic derivative or `ND` to calculate a numerical approximation

**To calculate the integral (antiderivative) of a function**, use the
 `Integrate` function to calculate a symbolic integral or `NIntegrate` to 
 calculate a numerical approximation.

**To calculate the limit of a function**, use the `Limit` function.

## Derivative

The derivative of a function is a measure of how the function changes as its input changes.
It is the ratio of the change in the value of a function to the change in its input value.
The derivative of a function $$ f(x) $$ with respect to its input $$ x $$ is denoted by:

<Latex flow="column" value="f'(x)"/>
<Latex flow="column" value="\frac{df}{dx}"/>


The derivative of a function $$ f(x) $$ is defined as:

<center>
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$
</center>

where $$ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} $$ is the limit of the ratio of the change in the value of the function to the change in its input value as $$ h $$ approaches $$ 0 $$.
 
The limit is taken as $$ h $$ approaches $$ 0 $$ because the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of the function at a point, and the change in the input value must be infinitesimally small to be instantaneous.

The `Derivative` function represents a derivative of a function with respect to a single variable.
The `D` function is used to calculate the symbolic derivative of a function with respect to one or more variables.
The `ND` function is used to calculate a numerical approximation of the derivative of a function.

<FunctionDefinition name="D">

<Signature name="D" returns="(number -> number)">_f_: number -> number, _var_: symbol</Signature>

The `D` function represents the partial derivative of a function `f` with respect to
the variable `var`.

<Latex value=" f^\prime(x)"/>

```json example
["D", "f", "x"]
```

<Signature name="D" returns="(number -> number)">_f_, ..._var_: symbol</Signature>

Multiple variables can be specified to compute the partial derivative of a multivariate
function.

<Latex value=" f^\prime(x, y)"/>

<Latex value=" f'(x, y)"/>

```json example
["D", "f", "x", "y"]
```

A variable can be repeated to compute the second derivative of a function.

<Latex value=" f^{\prime\prime}(x)"/>

<Latex value=" f\doubleprime(x)"/>

```json example
["D", "f", "x", "x"]
```







</FunctionDefinition>


<FunctionDefinition name="ND">

<Signature name="ND" returns="number">_f_: number -> number, _x_: number</Signature>

The `ND` function returns a numerical approximation of the partial derivative of a function $f$ at the point $x$.

<Latex value=" \sin^{\prime}(x)|_{x=1}"/>

```json example
["ND", "Sin", 1]
// ➔ 0.5403023058681398
```

**Note:** `["ND", "Sin", 1]` is equivalent to `["Apply", ["D", "Sin"], 1]`.


</FunctionDefinition>



<FunctionDefinition name="Derivative">

<Signature name="Derivative" returns="(number -> number)">_f_: number -> number</Signature>

The `Derivative` function represents the derivative of a function $f$.

<Latex value=" f^\prime(x)"/>

```json example
["Apply", ["Derivative", "f"], "x"]
```



<Signature name="Derivative" returns="(number -> number)">_f_: number -> number, _n_: integer</Signature>

When an argument $n$ is present it represents the _n_-th derivative of a function _expr_.

<Latex value="f^{(n)}(x)"/>

```json example
["Apply", ["Derivative", "f", n], "x"]
```


`Derivative` is an operator in the mathematical sense, that is, a function that takes a function
as an argument and returns a function.

The `Derivative` function is used to represent the derivative of a function in a symbolic form. It is not used to calculate the derivative of a function. To calculate the derivative of a function, use the `D` function or `ND` to calculate a numerical approximation.

```json example
    ["Derivative", "f", "x"]
is equivalent to
    ["D", ["f", "x"], "x"]
```

## Integral


The integral of a function $$ f(x) $$
is denoted by:

<Latex flow="column" value="\int f(x) dx"/>

<Latex flow="column" value="\int \! f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x"/>


:::info[Note]
The commands `\!` and `\,` adjust the spacing. The `\!` command reduces the space between the integral sign and the integrand, while the `\,` command increases the space before the differential operator `d`.

The `\mathrm` command is used to typeset the differential operator `d` in an upright font.

These typesetting conventions are part of the **ISO 80000-2:2009** standard for mathematical notation, but are
not universally adopted.
:::


The **indefinite integral** of a function $$ f(x) $$ is the family of all antiderivatives of a function:

<center>
$$\int f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = F(x) + C$$
</center>

where $$F(x)$$ is the antiderivative of $$f(x)$$, meaning $$F'(x) = f(x)$$ and $$C$$ is the constant of integration, accounting for the fact that there are many functions that can have the same derivative, differing only by a constant.

A **definite integral** of a function $$ f(x) $$ is the signed area under the curve of the function between two points $$ a $$ and $$ b $$:


<center>
$$\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)$$
</center>

<Latex flow="column" value="\int_a^b f(x) dx "/>

The `\limits` command controls the placement of the limits of integration.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int\limits_C f "/>

A **double integral** of a function $$ f(x, y) $$ is the signed volume under the surface of the function between two points $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ in the x-direction and two points $$ c $$ and $$ d $$ in the y-direction:

<Latex flow="column" value="\int_c^d \int_a^b f(x, y) dx dy "/>

The `\iint` command is used to typeset the double integral symbol.
<Latex flow="column" value="\iint\limits_S f "/>
<Latex flow="column" value="\iint\limits_S f(x, y) dx dy "/>



**To calculate the symbolic integral of a function,** use the `Integrate` function. 

**To calculate a numerical approximation of the integral of a function**, use the `NIntegrate` function.

<FunctionDefinition name="Integrate">
<Signature name="Integrate" returns="function">_f_: function</Signature>

Evaluates to a symbolic **indefinite integral** of a function $$ f $$.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int \sin"/>

```json example
["Integrate", "Sin"]
```

The argument `f`, the **integrand**, is a function literal, which can be expressed in different ways:

- As a symbol whose value is a function: `["Integrate", "f"]`
- As a symbol for a built-in function: `["Integrate", "Sin"]`
- As a `["Function"]` expression: `["Integrate", ["Function", ["Sin", "x"], "x"]]`
- As a shorthand function literal: `["Integrate", ["Power", "_", 2]]`
- As an expression with unknowns: `["Integrate", ["Power", "x", 2]]`


<Signature name="Integrate">_f_: function, ..._var_:symbol</Signature>

Symbolic **indefinite integral** of a function $$ f $$ with respect to a variable $$ x $$.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int \sin x \,\mathrm{d}x"/>

```json example
["Integrate", ["Sin", "x"], "x"]
```

Symbolic **indefinite integral** of a function $$ f $$ with respect to a variable $ x $ and $ y $.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int \sin x^2 + y^2 dx dy"/>

```json example
["Integrate", 
  ["Add", ["Sin", ["Power", "x", 2]], ["Power", "y", 2]], 
  "x", "y"
]
```


Symbolic **indefinite integral** of a function $$ f $$ with respect to a variable $$ x $$, applied twice.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int \sin x dx dx"/>

```json example
["Integrate", ["Sin", "x"], "x", "x"]
```


<Signature name="Integrate" return="function">_f_: function, ..._limits_:tuple</Signature>

A **definite integral** of a function $$ f $$. The function is evaluated
symbolically as: 

<center>
$$\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)$$
</center>

where $$ F $$ is the antiderivative of $$ f $$.



The `limits` tuples indicate the variable of integration and the limits of integration.

The first element of the tuple is the variable of integration, and the second and third elements are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively.


<Latex flow="column" value="\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx"/>

```json example
["Integrate", 
  ["Power", "x", 2], 
  ["Tuple", "x", 0, 2]
]
```

The variable of integration can be omitted if it is the same as the variable in the function.

```json example
["Integrate", 
  ["Power", "x", 2], 
  ["Tuple", 0, 2]
]
```

Double integrals can be computed by specifying more than one limits.
<Latex flow="column" value="\int_1^3\int_0^2 x^2+y^2 dx dy"/>

```json example
["Integrate", 
  ["Add", ["Power", "x", 2], ["Power", "y", 2]], 
  ["Tuple", "x", 0, 2], 
  ["Tuple", "y", 1, 3]
]
```

Some functions do not have a closed form for their antiderivative, and the integral cannot be computed symbolically. In this case, the `Integrate` function returns a symbolic representation of the integral. Use `NIntegrate` to compute a numerical approximation of the integral.



</FunctionDefinition> 

<FunctionDefinition name="NIntegrate">
<Signature name="NIntegrate" returns="number">_f_:function, ..._limits_:tuple</Signature>

Calculate a **numerical approximation** of the definite integral of a function.

<Latex flow="column" value="\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx"/>

```json example
["NIntegrate", ["Power", "x", 2], ["Tuple", 0, 2]]
// -> 2.6666666666666665
```

The `limits` tuples indicate the variable of integration and the limits of integration.

The first element of the tuple is the variable of integration, and the second and third elements are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively.

The variable of integration can be omitted if it is the same as the variable in the function.

```json example
["NIntegrate", ["Power", "x", 2], ["Tuple", 0, 2]]
// -> 2.6666666666666665
```



A double integral can be computed by specifying more than one limits.

  ["Tuple", 0, 2], 
  ["Tuple", 1, 3]
]
// -> 20.666666666666668
```

The numerical approximation is computed using a **Monte Carlo** method.

## Limit

The limit of a function $$ f(x) $$ as $$ x $$ approaches a value $$ a $$ is the value that
$$ f(x) $$ approaches as $$ x $$ gets arbitrarily close to $$ a $$.

It is denoted by:

<Latex flow="column" value="\lim_{x \to a} f(x)"/>

```json example
["Limit", ["f", "x"], "a"]
```

<FunctionDefinition name="Limit">

<Signature name="Limit" returns="number">_f_: function, _value_: number</Signature>

Evaluate the function _f_ as it approaches the value _value_.

<Latex flow="column" value="\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}"/>


```json example
["Limit", ["Divide", ["Sin", "_"], "_"], 0]

["Limit", ["Function", ["Divide", ["Sin", "x"], "x"], "x"], 0]
```

This function evaluates to a numerical approximation when using `expr.N()`. To
get a numerical evaluation with `expr.evaluate()`, use `NLimit`.

```

The numerical approximation is computed using a Richardson extrapolation
algorithm.
